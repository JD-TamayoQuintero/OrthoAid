The OrthoAid is an in-house software, developed at SBMU, to help orthodontists analyze pre and post operative 3D dental study models.

OrthoAid comes with the following functionalities:
- Draw occlusal and sagittal planes
- Calculate inclination of teeth to the occlusal plane
- Superimpose serial models on selected fiducials, using weighted least square method, and calculate distance between landmarks (e.g. tooth movements)
- Calculate distance of each point ot occlusal and sagittal planes
- Fit polynomial curve on selected lingual and buccal bracket points
- Choose the best arch wire available based on the lingual or buccal curvature of the dental arch
